1. Introduction
This Cookie Policy explains how FUSION FAIRIES LTD (“we”, “us”, “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website at cheffmate.co.uk. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
2. What are Cookies?
Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
3. Why do we use Cookies?
We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online platform.
4. Types of Cookies we use
We categorise our cookies into the following groups:
Category	Purpose
Strictly Necessary	Essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas, maintaining your login session, and managing your Token balance. Without these, the service cannot function.
Performance & Analytics	These help us understand how visitors interact with the platform (e.g., which chef courses are most popular) by collecting and reporting information anonymously.
Functionality	Used to remember choices you make (such as your preferred language or region) and provide enhanced, more personal features.
Targeting & Advertising	These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your culinary interests.
5. Specifically: AI and Token Security
Because Cheff Mate utilizes a Token-based economy and AI generation, we use specific cookies to:
•	Ensure that Token transactions are securely linked to your unique session.
•	Prevent "double-spending" of Tokens due to page refreshes.
•	Maintain the stability of the AI Cooking Assistant while it processes your recipe (which can take up to several minutes).
6. How can I control Cookies?
You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
•	Cookie Preference Manager: You can set your preferences in our cookie consent banner that appears when you first visit the site.
•	Browser Controls: You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject strictly necessary cookies, you may still use our website, though your access to some functionality (like the Dashboard and AI Assistant) will be restricted.
•	Opting Out of Analytics: To opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
7. How often will we update this Cookie Policy?
We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
8. Data Retention
Cookies set through our website have different durations:
•	Session Cookies: Deleted automatically when you close your browser.
